# FadingSnake
FadingSnake is a modern twist on the classic Snake game. The objective is to control a growing snake, collect apples, and avoid colliding with walls or itself. However, there's an added challenge **—the game grid gradually fades away**, making it harder to see and navigate!
Key Features:
•	Classic Snake Mechanics: Move the snake using arrow keys.
•	Fading Grid Challenge: The game grid fades over time, making it more difficult to track your movement.
•	Difficulty Modes: 
o	Easy Mode: Slower grid fading for a more relaxed experience.
o	Hard Mode: Faster grid fading and increased challenge.
•	Scoring System: Each apple collected increases the score and slightly restores grid visibility.
•	Smooth Animations: The snake transitions smoothly between movements for a polished experience.
